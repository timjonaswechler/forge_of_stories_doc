# Hurricanes, Blizzards, Dust Storms & More - Worldbuilder's Log 43

Good morning, Interweb. Worldbuilder's Log 43. We are, as always, continuing to build our fictional planet here. Placeholder name CRETAK. And in today's video, we'll continue mapping weather events. But before we do, I have quite a bit of follow-up to do.

If you're not interested in that at all, here's the timestamp or use the chapters to skip ahead.

First, a huge shout-out to Fantasy World History Simulator. Amazing YouTube channel. Like, subscribe, and smash the bells do what you need to do. Their basic style is that they've been building this kind of history simulation over the past five years. They reached out to me and were saying, hey, is there a chance to take CRETAK through the simulator, see what happens? I was like hell yeah. Then this is the result. Now, forgive me if it's a bit choppy. I'm probably recording at a weird frame rate compared to what you see on screen. Rest assured, their video is super smooth, but it's super cool. Look at this. They've got population numbers there. They've got random name generators for all sorts of political systems. I've got a simulated climate map. There's erosion going on to simulate rivers. How cool is that? So I highly highly recommend that you go check it out.

And especially 06:24 this timestamp of the video. I check it out. It's my favorite part. You might be like, okay, what does this mean? Are we going to now change our climate zone maps to fit with what's here. Are we going to change our river maps? Have we now solved culture? And the answer is no. This is largely non-canon. Basically, anything we do here on the videos or on the website. Artifexian.com - more on that in a second. That's kind of the source of canon. But I'm here for people who take everything on the site and do with it what they want, like Fantasy World History Simulator has done here.

Take it, fiddle with it, send it my way, I'm here for it. Fantasy World History Simulator total boss. Speaking of source canon, the website has been updated. Look, it's got a shiny new footer. How impressive. But for real. I've finally managed to add all the maps we've created. Oh, and I've created a new one here just for madness. A map for plate boundaries with marked all the types of ring of fire. Lots of ring of fires going on in this world. Stage of supercontinent reassembly, who'd have thunk it, right?

Now I want to give my props again to Jay Chukin. They've created this little animation here for the AZANI system, the system in which CRETAK rotates. Super fun. Amazing stuff. Thank you very much, Jay Chukin. You've made it to canon! The third shout-out goes to amazing citizen of the internet. Someone called Matsonoki. They reached out to me a few weeks ago and they were saying, I've made a solar analemma calculator, and here are the results for CRETAK.

And oh my God, amazing. I won't be able to show the whole video, it's 30 minutes long. But what it essentially is, is it's an animation of the solar analemma. And for anyone who doesn't know, that's kind of like, if you went out at the same time and the same location to take a picture of the sun, like every day of the year, it would trace a very particular part of the sky. That's the analemma. This, figure-eight thing in the middle there. So we're tracking that, and we're also tracking the day-night cycle through the seasons. Just, so, super cool. I recommend going to the website and browsing to see how things change over one year on CRETAK. Just oh my God Matsonoki. Just amazing.

And if that wasn't enough, Matsonoki was saying, here's the Desmos calculator. The software used to make this animation here it is. And just give it to everyone. Everyone can use it now. It's a little bit â€“ it's a bit dense. It's very advanced. You need to know what you're doing, but if you do, you can head here to all the settings, and modify things, and use it for your own world, and there you go.

You have an accurate tracking of the year. How cool is that?

Right, are there more awesome people I need to shout to, yes, meteorologists. Until the last video, actually, there are a lot of meteorologists, I lie there were two or maybe three meteorologists in the comments, which is two or three more than I think most YouTube videos, which is super cool. The meteorologists came and they assessed me and they gave me tips and tricks.

I won't go over everything here because there's a lot of text, but I just want to say thank you to @Capri3101. Pause and read the comment if you wish to, and @tfk_001. Your advice has been taken on board. Thank you very much.

And I'll update the maps accordingly, which still stands actually. Which means that the website isn't fully updated. I still have more maps to draw. Okay, I mean that's what I love. This is my life. I make maps. So the last thing I want to talk about before we start mapping properly is, what are we doing here? I probably should have clarified this ten videos ago. But here we are. Better late than never, am I right?! It might seem like I'm just kind of aimlessly worldbuilding and mapping - and that's not entirely untrue - but there is actually a goal here, as if there's a finish line with regards to this kind of geographical fantasy stage in the CRETAK project.

And that is humans. Humans are the goal. So, we're going to finish the geographical fantasy stage of this project by placing humans on CRETAK. Now, a small design goal I've set for myself here is that humans will not be ubiquitous, as in they won't inhabit every corner and nook and cranny of this world. They're only going to be like dropped in one or two or maybe three locations on the entire planet. You know, just for my own sanity more than anything else. And the whole reason behind us doing the tectonics, and the climate zones in the last video, and the thunderstorms, and the fog, and the aurora, and everything we're going to do in this video, then the two remaining subjects in this geographical fantasy stage, which are rocks and raw deposits. The reason we're doing all of that is simply to give us an idea of the environment of this world, and so I can make informed calls to where I want these humans to go.

Maybe we'll put them in a really nice place, or most likely, maybe I'll end up putting them in a really difficult place because I am the god of this world and what I say goes. So I think that all says there's a point. Every time I draw a map of something, I'm thinking, what does that mean for the environment? And how can it also inform culture?

All right, hope that makes sense. Let's do some maps. Oh, sorry. No one last thing. I've got a Discord if anyone is interested. Very bare bones at the moment, but links in the usual places. Go check it out. Right. Mapping.

As usual here, we're going to follow the amazing worldbuilding guide of Madeleine James, just as we did last time. Links in all the usual places. So the first thing I want to look at is the polar vortex influenced regions. I'm not going to map these on air, like fog in the previous video. You literally follow Madeleine James's guide and boom.

There's nothing for me to add here. Many of you will often assume that all this cool polar air is going to make its way down to the mid-latitudes and bring along Baltic conditions. That anyone living in the United States is familiar with the concept of the polar vortex, and as a first-order approximation, only landmasses - the eastern side of landmasses within about 30 and 50 degrees north and south can be subject to the influence of the polar vortex. And that's what I've marked here. But honestly, this is way too much specificity. For example, you can just circle yourself and note to yourself, like, in these areas, from time to time you can feel like you're in a winter from hell.

You definitely don't need to be super-specific about it. Okay? Polar vortex done. Let's talk about some hurricanes.

Right. Hurricanes and also known as tropical cyclones. And we all know what those are won't go into massive detail. The basic idea here is that these are tropical storms that form in tropical or subtropical oceans. And they form on the eastern side of these oceans and blow westward, hitting land in the west, often with devastating effects. So my plan here is to create a map like this.

The main thing I'm looking for here is kind of formation regions, these orange dots and very abstracted tropical storm patterns. This is what I'll try to mimic, which in fairness to Madeleine is basically what she's got here. But we'll make some small adjustments just because we're coming from different starting points.

Usual, you know. So let's focus on the northern hemisphere winter for hurricanes. Now tropical cyclones and very important things are kind of summer phenomena. So we'll only look at the summer hemisphere, which is the southern hemisphere in this case. So, for each of our oceans, we need to make an assessment as to whether we're going to get tropical cyclones in those oceans or not.

So let's go to this first ocean here. Let's check our wind maps and make the checks. Are we in the summer? Yes we are. Is this a tropical ocean? Yes it is. Is the ITCZ the dotted line here in said tropical ocean in the summer? Yes it is. Is this ocean warm? Now to assess this last one, we're going to have to strike our ocean current maps like this.

And basically all we're asking is, is polar water, water from near or inside the polar circle, entering the system. If it isn't, then it's going to be warm and we can have like hurricane maximum, where the formation region continues. And in this case, we don't have any polar waters from very high latitudes entering the system.

So this is kind of the warmest tropical ocean which means we can now determine the formation region. Now, hurricanes won't form within five degrees of the equator because of the Coriolis effect. So all I'm going to do is I'm fine, first and foremost, I actually put the temperature map here. Because I like to bias my formation regions towards the hottest part of the ocean.

So that'll be the purple area here. This is 27 degrees plus. So I'm going to start basically at about five degrees, which kind of aligns with the ITCZ here.

This is a very warm ocean. So I'll start from this coast and I'll draw a rather straight-ish line like this until we hit land. And then I'll come down to here and follow this hot area vaguely. I'm not obliged to stick to anything specific, but vaguely, like this. We'll call this the formation region. Amazing. So let's assess this stretch of ocean. Winds on. Is it summer? Yes. Is it a tropical ocean? Yes. Is the ITCZ in the tropical ocean in summer? Yes. Is it warm? So, again, we strike our ocean current layer. And there's an argument to be made here that this ocean will be "cooler" than what we just drew here, to the west. The reason for that is that this southern gyre here touches this gyre here which would have kind of cooling effect, because we've got waters coming from very high latitudes here.

Similarly, in this gyre here, some of this water is going to come from here as well. So it's coming directly from the polar regions. So there would be a significant cooling effect on the eastern side of this ocean at least. So I'd expect then that the formation region for these hurricanes wouldn't start at the coast of DEGRA, but might start halfway, across the ocean.

I say this because I measured this length of ocean off camera, and it's approximately the same as the Atlantic. And as you can see, in the Atlantic, we don't see any hurricane formation at all, really, during the southern hemisphere summer. But we've got a whole bunch of polar waters coming along the west coast of Africa here. And this kind of numbing, all of that.

We don't really have the same analogy here. So I thought, you know what? Instead of no hurricanes forming here, I'm going to push them into the middle of the ocean, like what happens between South America and Australia. So temporarily on. There bubble we've got. At least five degrees from the equator. So something like this.

Maybe this. Right, I'll rinse and repeat that for the other two sectors of the ocean here. I won't do this in a time-lapse. It's really the same thing over and over again. So, for the magic of YouTube editing, here are all our formation regions. Also change the color here because the orange is too orangey.

Little bit extra. Oh, actually, now that I've seen this, you know, this gulf here, isn't it? I get a little bit of Indian Ocean feelings from this.

Yeah. This kind of malarkey happening here. And there's an interesting development, I'll perhaps just expand this to fill in this gulf a little bit. Now we're cooking. Let's do some tracks now, the basic idea here is that our hurricanes and tropical cyclones are going to form on the eastern sides of our formation regions, and they're going to head westward. But because of the Coriolis effect, they're going to get gradually pulled towards the pole and eastward. You can see that reflected here in the abstraction.

But even in the more realistic data, you can see this kind of motion happening. So we're going to simulate that. Let's focus on this ocean here for now, or let's check our temperature maps. And it's really a simple case of starting a line in the east, pulling it westward, and then curving it towards the pole and perhaps back towards the east. And even though this is abstract, what I recommend is these tracks. Don't cross the 18 degree isotherm with these tracks.

The idea is that these are, again, kind of tropical phenomena, so they require warm conditions. Eventually, it's going to get too cold to support a proper tropical cyclone. And we'll call that the 18 degree line. So I think something like this then.

Well, that's not too bad. Rinse and repeat for all the other areas. Done northern hemisphere winter also known as southern hemisphere summer. Here's one I prepared earlier. And this is what the hurricane tracks look like in the other half of the year, when it's summer in the north. Same basic deal. So, unlike Earth, it has mostly nice open oceans.

Cretak here likes itself some horizontal landmasses. So, all the time here, you're going to get kind of hurricaned in the summer because it lies within the 18 degree isotherm. All of it. And this has a cool effect for...a bunch of CFB climate regions - again, think Greater Scilly Isles, Ireland, England, Scotland, that kind of jazz - a bunch of CFB climate regions, except proper hurricanes, which is inappropriate. It's really something we see on Earth. Like, yeah, definitely, like the little bits in New Zealand and Eastern Australia and Greater Scilly Isles here, they get kind of the remnants of these tropical storms, but not proper hurricanes in the same way that the southeastern US, you know. And that's super cool, year-round heavy rainfall plus hurricanes in the summer. How delightful. What a wonderful place to live.

Now, on a related note, let's now map some gale force winds.

Now, Madeline, gale force winds are associated with the polar and subtropical jet streams. These buoys here, are basically airstreams flowing west to east in the upper atmosphere. Like ten kilometers up. These guys go like the clappers, as in off the coast of Japan here. On day January 21, 2014.

They hit 370 km/h, which I don't know about you, but that's not slow. Now we have a problem, right? If gale force winds are associated with upper atmospheric movement, and we didn't map that, what do we do? The answer is not map the upper atmosphere. I don't know of any worldbuilder who's attempted that before. Actually, what I'm saying, if anyone has done something like that, it's probably Worldbuilding Pasta.

I mean what hasn't the dude done? Links in the description. Go check it out. If you live under a rock for whatever reason and haven't read the Worldbuilding Pasta blog, you're in for a treat my friend. Anyway, I digress, we don't have this map, so we're going to have to rely on our surface circulation maps to try to figure out how gale force winds work, which is something Madeleine does.

And she associates her gales with the polar and subtropical wind belts which happen at around 30 degrees north and south, and at around 50 to 60 degrees north and south. Now, me and myself, we have a very different map of atmospheric circulation. So I can't really tie gales to latitude in the same way that Madeleine does.

So here's the game plan. If we take another state with good land here, and note that the green here means gale force winds, we'll see that all the gale force winds on the planet happen kind of in conjunction with or as a result of atmospheric circulation cells over oceans, like here, here, here, here, here, here. And we can note here that gale force winds really happen at higher latitudes.

So, taking those two observations into account, what I think let's say is that gale force winds are generated by oceanic atmospheric circulation cells if the winds associated with those cells are allowed to blow over water for a long period of time only. And secondly, these winds aren't too far into the tropics, again the closer we get to the equator, the less forceful the winds become.

And the thinking behind the ocean here is that the friction between air and water is rather minimal, at least with regards to friction between air and land. So winds blowing over an extended area of ocean have the power to impress, and gain a lot of momentum, and then they can hit land and make landfall as gale force winds. On CRETAK here, just to illustrate, we are in the northern hemisphere winter again, if I zoom into this circulation cell, I imagine that this part of the coast here would be struck by gale force winds, because this pressure area is throwing off a whole bunch of winds that travel over the ocean for a long period of time, pick up a bunch of momentum, hit land, and gale force winds.

And this is the opposite of what happens here in JANNAR. We've got a similar circulation cell, except it's over land, and it has no ocean, so we cannot pick up a whole bunch of speed. So all of this would not be subject to gale force winds. So this is where our gale force winds will come from. And the next thing is we just need to talk about what we'll do when the gale force winds hit land.

And then I promise I'll start mapping. Basically, if there are small islands in the way of these gale force winds, they'll be classified as having gale force winds, for example, maybe here, for instance. If the gale force winds hit relatively flat plains, their effect will extend far inland. Again, this is as a result of the relatively low friction. And finally, if there's a coastal mountain range, like this boy here, the gale force wind effect will only extend as far as the mountain for the most part.

But often, if there is a gap in the mountain range which would act as a funnel, you know, if you have a garden hose and you put your finger over half the hose to cover it and turn on the water, the pressure increases, there's a stronger flow. Essentially the same thing will happen. So you might get little corridors of gale force winds that pierce through the mountain.

But for the most part, it will be confined just to the coastal lowland. I'll do a big old time-lapse of gale force winds. See you in a bit.

Okay. Gale force winds done! I may have overcooked some things here. I'm looking at you, JANNAR, and like the entire northern half of this continent is subject to gale force winds, which isn't something we really see on Earth. But, like, we've got winds coming from this ocean. We've got winds coming from this gulf. We've got winds blowing from this gulf here.

And I'm also saying that winds coming from sea ice here would be strong as well. Sea ice being relatively smooth, and less frictional, etc., resulting in this entire piece being exposed to gale force winds. And anyway, it's worth noting that this is all a prerequisite for the next step, which is blizzards and sand storms and things like that.

So I'm more than happy that I've overcooked that, because I can see blizzards happening basically anywhere in this northern half. JANNAR, you. So next on the agenda of gale force winds is katabatic winds. These are strong winds. Often hurricane-strong winds barreling down the Antarctic continent and hitting speeds up to 300 kilometers per hour, which is like race car speeds. Nuts!

So the basic mechanism here is that if you're in a cold region of the planet and you've got a bunch of cold air at elevation, this cold air is going to blow down the slope. And as it does that, it's going to warm up. But because we're in a cold region, this warmer air is still going to be warmer than the air at the surface.

So you get this sort of, temperature inversion happens, which contributes to or helps make these katabatic winds very very strong. So, in order to map ours, what we'll need to look for are cold regions where you have either an ice shelf like a big ice shelf or a large mountain plateau. Anywhere where there's a lot of cold air and you're sitting at elevation.

So, for instance, what immediately comes to mind here is this kind of northern half of the EZRI plateau. Big plateau, cold regional planet. Great. We're working with the wind pressure map anywhere the winds blow down the slope. So, on a large plateau or ice shelf, we can identify some katabatic winds like that.

Dead simple. So I'll go around the map, and put these in place. Chat with you a little bit.

Right, order done. Northern hemisphere winter katabatic winds. And finally, let's talk about fÃ¶hn winds, also known as foehn winds or fÃ¶hn winds or foehn winds. There's a whole bunch of pronunciation variations going on here. I will honor my ancestry and stick with the German pronunciation fÃ¶hn. These...you can almost think of these as the opposite kind of katabatic winds.

Like katabatic winds a bunch of cold air upslope flowing down. As mentioned before, fÃ¶hn winds are a bunch of warm air upslope flowing down. These are rain shadow winds. These occur in the rain shadow of mountains or mountain ranges. Air blows on the windward side of the mountain where it over the mountain tops or mountain range a bunch of energies are created. And this creates heat. So, you've got warm winds blowing downslope towards the lee side of the snow or in the rain shadow of the mountain. And this would enhance like clear-sky and sunny conditions on the rain shadow. So there are lots of effects here like these can take an already hot area. FÃ¶hn winds can take an already hot area and increase the heat dramatically.

Like the other winds we've discussed, they can be very strong. So in arid areas they can enhance and spread forest fires. And in cold areas they can enhance avalanches and warm winds and sudden snow thaws. Got it. So fÃ¶hn can go in the rain shadow of any mountain range. As if there's a rain shadow, you can just say fÃ¶hn winds happen there, but you want to bias it towards mountain ranges that have humid air on the windward side, or alternatively with a bunch of dry air coming down from above.

Let's say there's a bunch of dry air sitting on a plateau. It can come down as a fÃ¶hn wind. So, is it necessary to mark fÃ¶hn winds because you're kind of marking every mountain rain shadow? However, in an attempt to save time off camera, I went ahead and just drew the areas that stuck out to me here.

And this isn't comprehensive by any means. These purple areas here are fÃ¶hn winds. Windward side of the mountain, nice and humid. Windward side of the mountain, and fern winds rain shadow. These are our strong winds in the northern hemisphere winter. And here we are in the northern hemisphere summer. Neat. Right! Let's talk blizzards. For blizzards, I largely agree with Madeleine here. They happen mainly in winter and in regions of gale force winds.

Makes sense? But it's worth, I think, broadening the climates specifically here to all D climates and all E climates - all continental climates and all polar climates. Not just the coldest of the D climates. So let's go.

Those are all my regions in the winter hemisphere, gale force wind regions. Now I'm going to erase anything that's not in a D or E climate. Excellent. Now let's talk about sand storms.

Similarly for sand storms, I largely agree with Madeleine here. And they will be a summer phenomenon on our maps, and they'll be restricted to the summer hemisphere. They'll happen in deserts. And I'd like to extend that to semi-arid regions as well. So we'll do steppes and large flat plains.

And definition of deserts will be arid and free of vegetation. I think this last part is a typo. Anyhow, I don't agree with this. So, we're not going to tie sand storms to storm hazards, but only to the semi-arid or arid climate region in the summer hemisphere. Large and flat land. Let's do this.

Right, order sand storm. Now for the candy. The final cycle. Dust storms.

Now for dust storms, we're going to need to modify things a little bit. Basically because we don't have a drought map, and I don't want to tie things to storms. First thing I'll do is I'll put up my summer precipitation map, and select all precipitation, then I'll put up my winter precipitation map and add to the selection.

Flip this selection and fill it with the dust storm color. These are all the regions of the planet that don't receive significant rainfall throughout the year. These are regions that are kind of dry. Like sand storms, dust storms are a summer hemisphere phenomenon, at least for us.

So I'll select everything in the winter hemisphere here etc. Delicious! In our B climate regions, we have distinct sand storms so we need to get rid of them from the selection. And then I'll get rid of all the tundric climates. So tundra and polar climates. The last thing we need to do is get rid of anything that doesn't look like a large flat plain. Then we're done.

That's dust and sand storms and blizzards. Here's what the northern hemisphere winter looks like. Off camera, I've captured northern hemisphere summer, and it looks like this.

And with that, the weather is done. As we said at the beginning of the video. Next, we're going to tackle rocks and then raw deposits, and then we're functionally done with the geographical fantasy stage of the project. So I hope you'll join me next time.

Thank you very much for watching. Thank you to the channel's patrons for their support. Shout to Madeleine for her fantastic and wonderful guide. Links in the usual places. Continued shout out to the wonderful Ross Bay Geo for continued geographical advice. And yes, I wish you great folks. Until next time... Edgar out!
