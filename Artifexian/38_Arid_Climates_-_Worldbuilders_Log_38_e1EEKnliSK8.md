# Arid Climates - Worldbuilder's Log 38

Good morning, Interweb.
Worldbuilder’s log 38.
As always, we are continuing to
flesh out our fictional planet here.
Placeholder name CRETAK.
We're working on climate zones.
In the last video we dropped
in our tropical climate zones.
In this video,
we're going to drop in our arid
and semi-arid climate zones.
Sunscreen at the ready boyos.
It off to the deserts with us
So the köppen climate system
distinguishes
two types of desert climate.
BWh and BWk.
BWh here is the red.
BWk is the sort of pink color.
H stands for hot. K stands for cold.
So red is a hot desert
and pink is a desert that gets cold.
Very straightforward.
Here's what they might look like.
Lots of sand. It's
coarse. It's irritating.
It gets everywhere.
You might expect to see a Fremen
or a sand worm or two,
and maybe even an elderly Jedi.
We all know what deserts are.
So now to plot our deserts.
Definitionally,
these will go in regions
where the precipitation
is extremely minimal.
So for our purposes,
that means this will go in regions
where it's dry year round.
So if I put on my precipitation maps,
both my summer
and my winter precipitation
all at once, the black color here,
any region
that is not black is dry year round.
So it's a desert region.
Timelapse engaged.
I'm just going to go fill
that in now.
All right, desert done.
Now to figure out
which parts are hot deserts
and which parts are cold deserts.
By definition, if the desert region
has an average annual temperature
of 18 degrees C or greater, it's
going to be a hot desert region BWh.
And if the region has an average
annual temperature of less than 18°C,
it's going to be a cold desert. BWk.
So we're going to have to take
the temperature of our landmasses
at various different points.
So to do that, for example,
before I go into time lapse,
we can drop the opacity here
on the desert layer.
And that's throw
on our winter temperature.
And let's for argument's sake,
we're going to take the temperature
of this point here.
We can see that in winter it's 18°C.
And if we put on
the other temperature map
our summer temperature map,
the temperature is somewhere
between 36 and 30 closer to 30.
Let's call us 31.
We add that up.
So that's 49°C.
Divide by two to get the average.
And that's 24 24.5
that is greater than 18.
So we can mark this region here
with a H for hot.
So I'm just going to head into time
lapse
and takes temperature
for a whole bunch of points.
And just a little thing to note here
because it came up in comments
from the previous video.
We're only working
with two data points here.
We basically have a January
and a July map,
so deriving yearly average
temperatures from just two data
points will necessarily be less
accurate than if we had more data
points to work with.
So this is not a bug.
It's a feature because it'd
just be so prohibitively cumbersome
to manually make a whole bunch
of extra maps, say,
like a spring map and a fall map.
And it means that we kinda
have some artistic license.
We know there's a degree
of variability here,
using only two data points.
So we can move the boundary between
hot and cold deserts a little bit.
We can fudged a little bit
based on our kind of sensibilities.
Okay, so I think that's done.
What we got here
is we've basically established these
all these ks up here, K for cold
desert climate.
we basically have a line running
somewhere along here that delineates
cold and north cold desert and north
and hot desert in the south.
Except for the highest peaks
of this mountain range along here
will be cold desert as well, per
the temperature.
And I suppose it's obvious,
I guess, pointing out
I didn't take any temperatures
up here because like once
everything starts to be cold desert,
it's going to continue to be colder
and colder and colder
as we go to the poles on average
throughout the year.
So there's no point
taking the temperature.
But just to be absolutely sure
that I took
the temperature of the hottest part
of this section of EZRI here.
And again, that came out as cold.
Therefore, we can infer that
everything poleward will be cold.
So I'm going to block
fill in the colors. Now.
One thing I forgot to talk about,
but you may have seen me
do in time lapse there, is I kept
bringing up our hot and cold spots.
This red region here
we map those several several videos
ago, and I use this to inform
or help inform the
the shape of the transition
between hot and cold desert climates.
Because the hot spot shock
is a region that's abnormally hot.
Therefore, we would expect
we would want hot deserts to go
in these regions.
It would be kind of weird
if cold desert were in these regions,
except for obviously at elevation,
right?
So reference your continental T maps
and your hotspots
to help them form,
this mapping of arid climates.
Okay.
So with that done
off-air, I went ahead and applied it
to the rest of the planet.
And here is what we got.
God, EZRI is so dry.
Again,
all of those strategically placed
mountain ranges
just making the interior.
so dry compared to JANNAR.
But I think that's cool, right?
We got a diversity of kind of,
land types, a very wet continent,
a very dry continent.
I kind of like that.
Final thing we need to
do is talk about semi-arid climates.
So semi-arid climates or aka
steppe climates
aka BS climates,
if you will, come in two flavors.
They come in BSh climates,
that is hot steppe
shown in these dark
orange regions here and BSk climates.
Cold steppe
shown in these yellow regions here
for the hot steppes
think the Sahel in Mali for example,
and for the cold regions
think the sort of
the canonical steppe environment.
The Kazakh step up in here now
semi-arid climate, steppe climates.
They are extremely easy
and extremely difficult to plot.
They're difficult because we can't
rely on their formal definition
using the method we're using here,
because they called
for measuring precipitation
in millimeters and taking percentages
of the total precipitation
throughout the year,
which we can't do because we have
a very, crude precipitation map,
which is by design, but it makes this
a little bit tricky.
So plan B, notice how these steppe
climates appear to come in bands.
Also notice how they appear to ring
hot climates or arid climates rather.
So like if we take the Sahara
here, notice
how these steppes appear
to ring the Sahara.
If we take
like the Gobi desert up in here,
notice how we have steppes
ringing in the Gobi Desert.
You take the Australian outback
and you have a bunch of steppes
ringing the Australian desert.
So what steps are basically
is transitions
away from arid climates
into other climate zones.
And that is what I'm going
to do here.
And basically just going to ring
the arid zones I've just drawn.
And that would be our B climates,
our arid climates.
Done.
Now, an important question to ask
would be how expansive should these
transition zones, these transitional
steppe environments be?
I'm glad you asked that question.
Here is a graphic
that makes it very clear.
Shout out RossBayGeo for the info.
Love it!
The red region is the desert
and the orange region.
Here is a transitional step
inside the tropics.
Essentially, we'd expect
to find thinner steppe regions
outside the tropics.
We essentially we expect
to find broader, more expansive
steppe regions, which is what we see.
Right?
If you compare the Sahel here
to the Kazakh steppe, much thicker
here, thinner here, thicker
outside the tropics, thinner
inside the tropics
as a general sort of rule.
And here are some km ranges
that I'm going to be working from.
So additionally there's a whole bunch
of other considerations here.
So I'll just a rattle
them off, real quick
just in case they're applicable
to the world that you're working on.
One larger continents
mean larger transition zones
as a whole, i.e., skewing towards
the top end of these ranges here.
Colder, drier planets mean larger
transition zones on the whole,
whereas warmer, humid planets
mean narrower transition zones
regardless of planet type.
If there's a steep mountain slopes
or rapid elevation gain
that will cause a transition zone
in those regions to narrow
considerably.
Whereas if you have the opposite,
like a gentle rolling elevation
increase, the transition zone
can broaden and we'd expect steps
to disappear on the western side of
continents when they meet the ocean.
we can see this on Earth.
This again.
This is Sahara here.
Notice on the West, the transition
zones, the steps have disappeared.
Touching the ocean.
Same thing up here in Western
Australia,
same thing down in Chile, etc..
That's on.
I don't know if I just said this,
I can't remember,
but that's on prograde
planets, right.
Reversed that direction on retrograde
spinning planets.
And I think that's all of the points.
Hold on a second.
Yeah I think those
are the main points.
So all we got to do now
is just painting
the transition zones
around these climates.
Oh actually before I do that,
remember semi-arid climate
climates are still arid climates,
so we're not going to paint
in transition zones
outside of our arid zones
because there's ample precipitation
there.
We're going to paint into transition
zones inside of the arid
climate zones.
Also remember very important
the steppe climates.
They are transition
zone away from arid climates.
So we would not expect
a steep climate
to transition cold to hot.
We would not expect this,
but we would expect
to have a arid climate in here.
Transitioning arid
into something like continental
or oceanic or something like that.
So I'm going to hop
into timelapse mode now and create
some steps you'll see that
I'm tracing from, a layer
that I've overlaid on the map.
That layer was created using
a combination of GPlates and Blender.
Long time viewers of the series
will know the shtick,
but basically in GPlates.
I created this
cyan line that you can see,
and that's a very rough polygon
there to just gauge the distances
from the edge of the average zones.
Then the black line was a line
that I created in blender in 3D
to ensure that there's no distortion.
And that's the final line.
So I'm just copying it here
and putting it onto the map proper.
And the other thing to note here,
it's pretty self-evident
is that around cold deserts,
you get cold steps
around hot deserts you get hot steps.
So where there's pink.
We get this yellow boundary zone.
Where there's red,
we get an orange boundary zone.
So yeah, sit back, relax, have a
gander at some steps being created.
And if something pertinent comes up,
I will hop out of timelapse mode
and talk to you all.
If not, I'll see you again
at the end of the time lapse.
All right.
Time lapse. Done. As I am
want to do.
I got a little bit carried away.
I ended up, like, editing the tundra
a little bit.
Here we are. There still.
Still not perfect.
Still want to fix this region here
a little bit and do some more editing
of the tundra up here
now when I think about it.
But I'll do the off camera.
You don't need to see that
in timelapse
because the important thing is done.
Our B-climates, our arid climates are
in this is how EZRI looks.
And if we zoom out, let's
see how the rest of the world looks.
Bada bing, bada boom.
How delightful.
And I guess the only thing
I'd like to highlight
now is the fact that very thin,
arid zones will become
completely covered in steppe.
This might have been obvious
due to time maps,
but just to talk about it,
say for example, over here,
these are tall, kind of like
peninsulas of arid zones.
Following the measurements
we talked about earlier,
necessarily
the steppe region will come in
from the north,
the south east, the west, etc..
So if we imagine 200km worth
of steppe from the northern boundary,
200km, worth of steppe
from the southern boundary, etc.
lo and behold, there's no arid left
here.
It's only steppe.
So expect
small, thin regions of arid zone
to get completely covered in steppe
And we can see the same thing
happening here over in JANNAR.
This whole bit is just too thin
to have an arid zone.
The arid zone
only exists in this thicker region.
And for a real world example,
you can check out like say,
the likes of the Deccan Plateau
in India.
Here,
the region is just not expansive
enough
to house a full fledged desert.
And one last thing.
Last video.
I talked about
how I will likely connect up
the savanna regions here,
because if we look at the topography,
we have a mountain range here
acting as a rain shadow.
But we are right on the equator here.
So again, around
the equator is a very moist region.
So there is a strong argument
or there's an argument to be made
that this savanna region
should connect up.
And I think I might do that here.
So I'm just going to connect up
the savanna zones here.
Cutting off the desert.
I'm just not comfortable to desert
sitting here at,
you know, at the equator
given this configuration of land.
So I won't time lapse this because,
you know, it's
not part of the theme of the video.
So through the magic of YouTube
editing.
This is what it looks like.
Done!
You know those videos on the internet
where like, a small baby sees
their father who usually has a beard,
but the father has just shaved
and the baby doesn't
know what to make of it?
Kind of having those feels right now.
I've been staring at DEGRA so long
with the deserts in the configuration
that they were in, because I did it
like ages and ages ago.
Now, seeing the savanna here
just feels really wrong.
There's nothing actually like
technically wrong with it.
I'm just used to
seeing red here, that's all.
All right.
B-Climates, our arid and semi-arid
climates.
Done!
Next time we talk,
we're going to talk. C-Climates.
The temperate climates
have a great one, folks.
Thank you for watching.
Oh, shout out RossBayGeo again for
all of the behind the scenes advice.
Look after yourselves.
And until next time.
Edgar out!
