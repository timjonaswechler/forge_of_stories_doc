# Final Fixes and Tweaks - Worldbuilderâ€™s Log 8

good morning interweb world builders log
eight today we're going to do a
polishing up tweaking video but first as
always follow-up
first point of follow-up should have
mentioned this in the last show but
didn't the apparent size and brightness
sheet does not take into account orbital
inclination or orbital eccentricity
this is just to simplify calculations
both of those parameters would affect
how bright various objects would appear
but for the sake of simplification the
spreadsheet just assumes those values
are zero
next up uh people were asking what the
values on the various axes of the chart
are they are distances in a you they've
now been marked in on the chart in the
latest version of the spreadsheet you
can go download it links in the
description one person asked whether or
not my gas giant would have rings
answer yes but they're not gonna be like
saturn's rings they're gonna be more
like the rings of jupiter or neptune or
uranus purely because if i was to give
my gas giant saturnian like rings i'd
want to like do the math on them figure
out how wide they are where the gaps are
how thick they are etc
and that's kind of beyond the scope of
this kind of simple basic sort of setup
so gas giant has rings just very tenuous
ones and the final point of follow-up
lots of people are asking how i make the
reference dock
i use an app called adobe indesign like
i'm already paying for the adobe suite
so i figured i may as well use their
kind of like magazine layout app thing
here also this series is just a really
good excuse for me to learn a new app
if you've got the adobe suite go check
it out i think this app is really cool
if you don't and you're on mac you could
use apple pages although i really
dislike apple pages
but it might work for someone you can
also just use google docs or microsoft
word although i find that strict word
processors handle
image placement
not as well as sort of these kind of
more like magazine layouty type apps i
don't even know what they're really
called
but yeah that's what i use adobe
indesign
and that is follow-up done
let's do some polishing
so i'm going to go back over all the
sheets and change some things here and
there i'm not going to explain what each
of the parameters are because we've
already done that in previous videos so
this is going to be a bit of a like a
speed run
so the star i am perfectly happy with
star nothing needs to change here
same thing with the galaxy i'm pretty
cool my solar neighborhood i don't think
i want to go change anything
here yeah planetary system for now
i'm okay but i i want to change the
orbit of my home world which we'll get
to in a bit so this this may change it
may not we'll see
now the planet tab
there are a couple of things here i want
to change
first being the atmosphere
so recall that this planet with an
earth-like atmosphere oh actually no i'm
just going to do that okay let's return
this to a kind of more earth-like
atmosphere in terms of carbon dioxide so
uh i recall the earth has about 0.04
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere i think
let me just fact-check that
yeah 0.04 and change
so with earth-like levels of greenhouse
gases the greenhouse effect on the
planet will be equal to one as
previously explained and that puts the
sort of like air quotes natural state of
this world at about negative three
degrees celsius which is hella cold and
not something i want i want it to be
close to modern earth-like values
so what i did was i just randomly chose
0.16 percent carbon dioxide and then
bumped the greenhouse effect up to 1.9
which is fine but it's kind of like
plucking numbers out of thin air
so i did a bit of digging
came across this site eos
an unbroken record of climate during the
age of the dinosaurs so the kind of like
study of the cretaceous period
with a view to how it can afford inform
us about greenhouse gases and global
warming and there was an interesting
line here if i can find it back
here these conditions resemble the most
extreme scenario that the ipcc that's
the intergovernmental panel on climate
change has predicted could occur by the
end of the century with co2 levels
greater than 1 200 parts per million by
volume and global temperature
temperatures roughly four percent higher
so i was like okay cool let me just take
this value of 1200 parts per million per
volume and use it to increase
the
temperature of the planet by four
degrees celsius so it's something a
little bit more concrete to go on as
opposed to just picking numbers out of
thin air so let's do that let's see
where that gets us so
first we need to convert this into parts
per million and that's really simple to
convert a percentage to parts per
million you simply take that percentage
and you multiply it by 10 000.
so in this atmosphere carbon dioxide is
at 1 600 parts per million
so let's make that 1 200 so we drop this
to 0.12 yeah 1 200 parts per million and
again going off
this here that's going to increase the
temperature by 4 degrees celsius
so if we pop back up to our greenhouse
effect earth is one so i'm gonna fill up
with this until this is increased by
four degrees celsius ie until we get to
one degree celsius
there we go okay so the greenhouse
effect is 1.2
now that
obviously
is not the same as modern day earth
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
move my planet inward in the habitable
zone to increase the temperature
so if i take my semi-major axis let's go
1.65
and we'll see that that increases the
temperature
so
1.609 degrees i want to get to between
14 and 16 degrees
1.59 we're getting there 1.58
five seven
five six nearly there five five
five four okay so we were previously at
14 degrees celsius
and now we're back there except we're
using kind of
like i said more concrete
co2 to temperature change
figures
so if we go back to our pantry system
tab this boy needs to be at
1.54 au
so there's two things i could do here
i could change the spacing factor and
the first orbit
to rearrange the titus bull law old law
here to get my habitable world at 1.54
exactly
which is which is doable except i would
have to just change all the orbits and
redo everything and actually i
definitely don't want to do that okay so
in the apparent size and brightness tab
i really liked the way the system was
coming out in that the gas giant was
very visible in the night sky
so too were the ice giant and the rocky
path except due to their distances and
sizes
they were kind of relatively difficult
to see
so you have kind of like fuzzy inner and
outer boundaries and in the middle
everything's crystal clear i really
enjoyed that
if i move this around like for example
if i go one point spacing factor of 1.04
and the first orbit at 0.5 a u
that will move
my all my orbits inward a bit
because my ice giant
yeah it was at 18 a.u
and with this change it would move like
1au inwards
which is probably not going to be great
let me try that so let's start that's
17.14 17.14 and now we have yeah our ice
giant here is visible at night and it's
it's a naked eye planet and it's bright
so it's no longer possibly visible
i don't really like that so i'm gonna
opt for the second option here
which is simply to say
that the habit world is at this orbit
and bold's lobby damned which is
perfectly acceptable because if you
apply bold's law to our system the
planets it predicts fairly well are in
and around
the numbers it spits out they're rarely
ever just spot on so i think that's the
easiest thing to do here minimal changes
and also we don't lose the kind of
coolness with our system so i'm just
gonna yeah i'm just gonna move the habit
world done okay back to planet tab so
all of this extra co2 in the atmosphere
has to be coming from somewhere
humans will be present on this planet
but they won't be heavily industrialized
so they won't be pumping out a bunch of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere so
it has to come from the planet and the
usual mechanism here is just volcanism
so our planet needs to be very
volcanically active or at least be in a
period of increased volcanism so i did a
bit of reading and i had said previously
that plate tectonics began to be
suppressed at around 3.5 earth masses
apparently it's lower than that
apparently it's somewhere around two
although this is a very nebulous thing
to talk about and it's just really fudgy
but just to be safe i thought what i'd
do is drop the massive planet down
to something a little bit more
conservative to make the whole increased
volcanism thing be a little bit more
believable really active plate tectonics
lots of volcanism so i will drop that
down just below the two earth masses so
let's say
1.9
which will decrease the size of the
planet and decrease the gravitational
pull but that's okay because we're still
we're still chunky
uh maybe maybe
yeah
fancy decimal places okay so that is the
carbon content of the atmosphere moving
the planet mass what else is left oh yes
density so way back i got a really cool
message from alexi
vlasenko and they were like hey instead
of just choosing a density for a planet
maybe consider basing it off the mass of
the planet and the mass of the iron core
in the planet and they supplied this
empirical formula
which i think is
really cool so i'm going to apply this
formula to the spreadsheet we'll see
what we get and then if you guys like
that functionality i'll add it to the
main spreadsheet
alright so time-lapse time
okay so i had put in 6.61 grams per
centimeter cube for my original planet
of 2.7 earth masses in fact let's just
put that back in so i'm gonna copy that
value just paste it over here for
posterity
okay so the formula here predicts a
density of 6.72 grams per centimeter
cubed and i had 6.1
so i was
a little bit off of what the empirical
formulas tell us
and let's pop this back in then
so the basic shtick here with this
giganto formula
is that it takes the core mass fraction
of earth checks your mass and then spits
out a
empirically proven density should we say
and the core mass fraction is like how
much of the mass of the planet
does the core take up as a percentage
the value for earth is about 0.35 so
assuming the same core mass fraction for
our planet which i think is a good
assumption to make we should get a
density of 6.62 i think that is class so
let me know if you want
that in the official release what that
will basically mean is that this cell
will no longer be used user editable
it'll be auto-generate which i think is
actually great but do but do let me know
so that
i think is the planner tab everything
else i am
happy with
yes
yeah okay onwards moon tab
do we want to change anything
in the moon tab master planet all stuff
is going to change
this is all fine but we may as well use
the new density equation here as well so
hold on time-lapse engaged be back in a
second
okay and what is the core mass fraction
of the moon
yes the canberra moon festival that's
exactly what i wanted
okay so it's 20 the radius of the moon
i'm not sure that's what i'm after
hmm
hmm okay more research needed
gotta go to page two here that's how you
know deep research is occurring
okay
our estimates are estimates of a
presently relaxed lunar cmb with a cmv
core mantle boundary translates to a
core mass fraction in the range of one
point five nine to one point seven seven
percent
with a present day free core
nutation notation within 365 plus or
minus 100 years okay so most of that is
greek to me but is that
is that the core mass fraction of the
moon okay hold on more research
okay so in around the two to three
percent
which kind of tracks with that
okay for an iron rich composition a core
of this size the lunar corp represents
merely one to three percent of the
moon's total mass okay so in and around
that sort of range seems to be a thing
let's just call it two percent
so we need to edit the thirty five
percent to two percent
i think that's right
two percent two percent two percent two
percent and two percent okay so this was
the moon one moon mass
we'd end up with a density of 3.5 grams
per centimeter cubed which is fairly
close i think the moon's density is 3.34
grams per centimeter cubed so i think
we're
we're gravy there
okay yeah three points
let's do those
okay
yeah that's barely a change which is
kind of neat
if i do implement this in the actual
spreadsheet i'll put in a box i think
for you to select
what percentage of the mass of the
planet is the core and that will modify
this equation somewhat so it's not hard
numbers but for me i'm just going to go
with the moon's core for the moon and
earth's core earth earth's core mass
fraction for terrestrial planets okay
so
fine
fine
it's going to have effect on the tides i
think the tides have diminished somewhat
fine that's not too bad
29.167 did that change
did change it did change okay
oh and our year lengths changed as well
so what was that that was your length
was this chip
okay so what am i getting here
21 local months
hmm
i like this spread of leap years we'll
talk about this at a later stage this is
kind of fun
yeah i think i want to decrease the
amount of months again so let me fiddle
with this
that's nice
30.167
okay which polishes our semi-major axis
out a bit
which reduces the tides even further
fine okay cool
apparent size and brightness so this has
changed
so daylight has become brighter and the
apparent size of the star in the sky has
become bigger as well because we've
moved our planet inwards cool we did not
alter semi-major axes of our planet so
we're fine here happy with that
nothing has changed here nothing has
changed here
everything stays the same why is that
bright
oh snap
wait a second hold on
okay yeah so it is still
our outermost gas giant or our outermost
ice giant is still at the cost of
visibility
yeah
okay
radio i haven't changed
yeah okay cool the moon has changed
and the radius of the moon will also
have changed where is my radius here we
go
knights have become brighter makes sense
we've moved the planet and the moon
inwards
they're still pretty dark
and the apparent size has
can remember is that unchanged either
way total eclipses are still possible
boo
um
yeah okay so i think
yeah i think that's everything there
climate zones we've not touched that yet
populations we've not done that calendar
we've done okay i'm gonna do one final
sweep and then that's it for the
polishing episode and we'll get on to
more earth sciencey mapping climate zone
stuff in the next video so time lapse
engaged
wait a minute outermost gas giant 38u
that is incorrect
that is incorrect and this is also
incorrect oh edgar you silly man oh no
wonder okay that makes sense okay okay
okay so 18.04
yeah because we have a rocky patch we
have earth
or the earth like planet skipping that
orbit
we have
a dwarf planet in an asteroid belt here
we have our big gas giant and then we
have our ice giants it's 18.04
18.
cool and that will drop
yeah there we go we're on the cosp again
okay that's why that was the case got it
um okay
and then this has to be
18.04 which means that our kuiper belt
moves inwards obviously god i hope i
actually brought that in the
in the reference stock hold on
yeah there we go 23.64 to 28.64 i
believe that's the same
yeah look at that
smart past edgar
okay
um back to time lapse
i just bump up argon just for a crack
okay so that really is fun so if our ice
giant is at its closest to our home
world its magnitude is plus five and
that really is
right on the cusp that is fun that is
cool
hmm
that is some messiness there we'll deal
with that down the road
yeah same thing that we have to deal
with that down the road okay okay
all right that is that
carbon dioxide rectified move their
planet inwards as a result reduce the
mass of the planet and then utilize new
density equations
plus the fallout thereof okay polishing
up episode done
i hope you enjoyed thank you so much for
watching thanks for supporting the
channel on patreon love each and every
one of y'all until next time
edgar out
