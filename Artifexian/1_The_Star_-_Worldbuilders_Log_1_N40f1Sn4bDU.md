# The Star - Worldbuilderâ€™s Log 1

good morning interweb builders log one
today we're going to start construction
of our new fictional universe
specifically we are going to start with
where i like to start always with a star
system
in keeping with the ethos of this series
i'd like things to be fairly
straightforward so i'm thinking of going
with
a single star system
with that star being a main sequence
star
which i'll explain in a little bit
probably a minimal amount of planets say
maybe
two to four
and one of those being a habitable world
something like that not too radical no
star system without a star so let's
begin there now anyone who knows me
knows that i absolutely love just
crunching numbers and doing the math on
my world building but i appreciate that
not everyone is into maths the way that
i am so what i've done is i've made a
thing called the world smith
and this is part of the reason why i've
been gone for like four months i was
prepping for this series part of that
prep was creating this this is a
spreadsheet
like a suite of calculators and guides
that is basically all the basic
information on artifexian over the past
like six or seven years condensed into a
single spreadsheet and we'll be using
this throughout this series this
spreadsheet is entirely free to use
anyone can use it all you need to do is
go down to the description of this video
and all the videos in this series click
on the link and then you will be met
with something that looks like this and
all you need to do is hit make a copy
and that will save a copy of the world
smith to your google sheets now that
copy will be a hard copy i if i make
changes to the world smith those changes
won't be reflected in your copy so it
might be worth periodically coming back
and downloading the spreadsheet again to
make sure that you have the most current
and up-to-date version and is there
anything else on that before we begin oh
yeah between myself and the patrons
we've tried to debug this as much as
possible but i'm sure there's still some
bugs and errors in here if you happen to
spot one please let me know and i will
rectify it asap all right without
further ado let's start building a star
first up what even is a main sequence
star so main sequence stars are sun-like
stars stars that are fusing hydrogen
into helium in their cores they're in a
thing called hydrostatic equilibrium
they're really stable they just kind of
keep on keeping on not changing much
over geological time it's kind of like
the midlife period of a star's evolution
you know they got a good government job
a partner 2.5 children a dog and a white
picket fence everything's gravy no
hassle no drama prime real estate for a
habitable world
now all stars including main sequence
stars are categorized using the o
b
a
fine
gongan
kiss me
system with all stars representing high
mass stars
and m stars representing the lowest mass
stars
with a gradient formed in between so b
stars are a little bit less massive than
all stars a stars are a little bit less
massive than b stars and so on all the
way down to the lowest mass stars m
stars now high mass stars and low mass
stars have
opposing characteristics
so high mass stars will be very large
they'll have large radii they'll also be
very luminous they'll output a lot of
energy and they'll be really hot
but they won't live for very long and
their densities will be relatively low
and they'll be blue in color low mass
stars are the polar opposite they're
very small so they have a low radius
they don't put out an awful lot of
energy ordinarily their temperature is
quite low but they live for a really
long time and they're quite dense
and they're red
and again there's a gradient in between
now the spreadsheet accepts masses
between 0.075
to i think it's 99 solar masses
and the solar mass fyi is equal to the
sun so our sun is one solar mass so if
your star was two solar masses it would
be twice as massive as our sun sol
basically means relative to our sun if
your star is lower than 0.075 solar
masses it's not a star it's a brown
dwarf and if it's greater than 99 100
masses i'm not even sure main sequence
stars can get that massive so i don't
actually know what it would be and in
any case the upper end of the spectrum
is weird and nebulous so i wouldn't
really go near it in fact i would
advocate that the only range that's
really applicable to us is not 0.5 to
1.4 solar masses in fact let me just
move this
up here
think of this as being like the
habitable range
and if you go outside this range
you run into
a few issues regarding you know organic
life habitability etc so with very high
mass stars the problem is uv radiation
and like just time
high mass stars output their peak
radiation in the uv and too much uv is
really bad for organic matter so that's
a hinderance for life perhaps a bigger
hindrance is the fact that very high
mass stars have very low lifespans and
if we assume that earth is not abnormal
here
and it takes life billions of years to
evolve
many high masters only live for millions
of years
so there's not enough time for life to
evolve naturally on planets orbiting
those stars they could be colony
locations for sure but naturally
evolving life is a bit tricky
with low mass stars there's also two
problems
flares
and locking
so remember low mass stars don't put out
an awful lot of energy so therefore if
we want our planet to receive earth-like
levels of heating that planet's going to
have to orbit really close to that
low-mass star and there will come a
point where it's so close to the star
that it'll be locked to the star i.e
it'll the planet would present the same
face to its star always think like the
moon and earth the moon always presents
the same face to earth except apply it
to a planet and star a planet will
always present the same face to its star
that's not a deal breaker for
habitability
it just makes it
very not earth-like and will present
further problems down the road i would
consider it more of an advanced build
the bigger problem for habitability not
insurmountable though is flares
very low mass stars tend to be flare
stars
and these are stars where
randomly they'll just decide to like
double triple quadruple their energy
output in the southern burst
and remember a habit of world orbiting a
low mass star would be quite close to
the star so that means every so often
just randomly the whole planet will
become completely irradiated which is
just
very bad news for habitability
none of these again are insurmountable
they just present problems and this mass
range here makes so that if you pick a
mass in this range these problems won't
be an issue for you so let's just chuck
in a random mass here oh fyi as per the
big red border only edit blue cells if
you edit any of the other cells the
whole spreadsheet will break and that's
terrible and if ever you run into issues
you don't know what to do just hover
over the eye icon and there's a big
write-up i've done so again you should
be fairly sorted so yeah anyhow let's
throw in a mass let's put let's put the
lower end of the spectrum not 0.5 so 9.5
solar masses i this star is half as
massive as the sun
spreadsheet populates and we get all
this loveliness
so our class is a k star so we're down
near the bottom end
9.2 v now i need to explain this each of
these categories can be further
subdivided with a numeral
i think it's 0 to 9.9 if i recall
correctly
and the way it works is that 0
represents the highest mass of a given
class and 9.9 represents the lowest mass
of a given class so a k 0 star highest
mass k star a k 9.9 star lowest mass k
star so this boil will be near the
bottom of the k spectrum and then v here
or rather roman numeral five that's just
the label we give to a main sequence
star
none of this actually matters just a
cool bit of flavor text now we can see
that the maximum age of our star is 80
giga years a giga year is a billion
years so this star will live for 80
billion years which is a long time and
like longer than the age of the universe
longer than time itself our universe
literally hasn't existed long enough for
some of the lower mass stars to die
which is just like nuts when you think
about it in the current age tab all you
need to do is input the age of your star
it can be anything as long as it's less
than the maximum age and obviously less
than the age of your universe so i don't
know let's say 13.7 billion years well
hey there you go
radius size of the star units or salts
or solar radii so this boil is 0.57
times as big as our sun
luminosity how much energy puts out
units are l-sol so that's solar lumens i
think or solar luminosities
so this boils about six percent
as luminous as our sun so i wasn't
joking when i said that low-mass stars
luminosity very low density
self-explanatory 2.6 times as dense as
the sun temperature when dealing with
astronomical um structures temperature
is usually listed in kelvin but you can
easily convert that via a quick google
search into celsius or fahrenheit if you
want
star color now this is a thing the color
represented here
is kind of an attempt at true color so
if you imagine you're in space you're
not in an atmosphere it's floating in
space and you're looking at this star
here
and somehow magically the exposure of
the light has been dropped such that it
doesn't blow out your eyeballs
this is likely the color that you would
see in that scenario so kind of a true
color devoid of the shortcomings of
human vision the actual color the star
will appear to be on the surface of a
planet like a human
looking at star on the surface of planet
would likely be white because stars even
the lowest luminosity stars are still
really luminous and they'll just over
expose your eyeballs and just everything
appears white
now that is slightly contentious because
i've seen sources that state that yeah
all stars will appear white except for
the really low mass stars like the k and
m stars those stars they'll appear more
like
whitey orange so like white with a tinge
of orange or red in them
i can't actually verify
what would actually occur would they
just be pure white or white tinged with
a warm color i don't actually know i
just usually say white
and i'm happy with that so watch out for
that one hablo zone really simple this
is a
area of space around your star where if
a planet orbits in this area
it will receive relatively earth-like
levels of heating closer to the inner
limit here the warmer your planet is
closer to the outer limit here the
cooler your planet will be and the units
here are astronomical units and one
astronomical unit is i think 150 million
kilometers if i recall correctly
basically the distance from earth to the
sun that's how an astronomical unit is
defined and finally the spreadsheet runs
a check to see whether or not earth-like
life could be supported on a planet
orbiting in the habitable zone around
the star that you've created if the star
falls within this range of masses and
sufficient time has passed such that a
planet could have formed around the star
and then life could form unsaid planet
the spreadsheet would return yes
if that's not the case the spreadsheet
would return no and sometimes a
spreadsheet would return star too young
like if i do
this
and what that means is that all the
conditions are correct it's just that
the age you start isn't old enough for
life to have evolved
or for life comparable to earth to have
evolved
and that cutoff if i recall correctly is
yeah 3.5 billion years
now that's a bit of a fudge and there's
no real way of knowing exactly how long
it takes for life to evolve
you know sample size of one and all but
after having talked to a few folks it
seems like 3.5 is a fairly good
somewhat conservative estimation of how
long would take life to evolve so if
your star is younger than 3.5 billion
years not enough time to have you know
terrestrial mega floor and fauna
all right so that is the spreadsheet
explained mass explained cool
let's actually now build the star i want
i don't want the star at all i think i
am going to go for a relatively high
mass star
yeah let's just let's just input the
highest mass in this range
okay see where that gets us
and the reason why i'm doing that is
remember high mass star lots of energy
a planet with earth-like levels of
heating would need to orbit far away
from said star
the further out the orbit the longer a
year is on the planet so i'm kind of
envisaging a habitable world with a very
long year length
hence the high mass now immediately i
see a bit of an issue here maximum age
of star is 3.6 billion years and our
current age is 3.5 billion years as low
as i'm comfortable going and still
declaring that there is terrestrial
mega floor and fauna existing on this
world that only gives us a hundred
million years wiggle room before the
star exits the main sequence and i
suspect the star will begin to show
signs of volatility
a little bit before it officially exits
the main sequence so i think this is a
bit tight here so i think this star is
too massive let me reduce this down
what's 1.3 m look like so max mage is
4.5 billion years current age is 3.5 so
that's a billion years if i go down
another little bit go to 1.2
1.2
1.2
okay so it's 2.2 billion years let me
increase this little bit give us a
little bit more wiggle room let's say
4.2 so there's 1.5 billion years
before the star exits the main sequence
plenty of time we're not running into
any issues there
cool and actually you know what today is
the 24th of june so let's uh let's just
put a mass of
2022.06 let's do that
just as a fun little easter egg
okay cool radius 12 bigger than our sun
fine with that luminosity 2.2 times
greater than our sun cool density about
90 that of our sun
now you might think densely like who
cares about density of a star all of
these parameters have ramifications
going forward in the other spreadsheets
down the bottom here
so they all matter specifically density
is going to be used to plot how close a
planet in the planetary system could get
to the star so there's they all have
relevance
temperature fine grand star color cool
it's white no hassle there um
have a zone yep nice and far out so we
get some really long years up to about
700 earth days depending on the rotation
of the planet that's really long
earth-like life yes because we stuck to
the mass range and our age is greater
than 3.5
cool
and that is nearly everything no oh one
last thing so that is the current age of
the star
current
age
of the star
is 4.2
gig years that's obviously not the
current age of the planet because it
takes a while for a planet to form after
stars formed and i might need to
actually google this i think our sun is
4.6 billion years isn't it how old is
the sun it's 4.6
billion years yeah i think the earth is
4.5
how old is the earth
the earth is 4.5 it's about 100 million
years in it again so yeah let's say
current earthquake is
4.1 giga years
yeah let's do that
cool so barring future changes i'm gonna
say that's canon i like these figures
it's habitable it's fairly earth-like
and it gets me that long planetary year
i'm after so that's cool now what i'm
going to do is i'm going to delete all
this off air and i'm going to do a
little write up like create a reference
document for this setting and i think
i'm going to release that to the patrons
as an extra little thank you for
supporting the show so that's something
you're interested in links are in the
description go over to patreon check it
out also i've changed all the tiers on
patreon just fyi and there's a new
director's commentary tier where the
first saturday after each of these
videos is released i'll do like a only
live stream and we sit down and we talk
about the episode in greater detail
field some questions etc so again if
that's the thing you're interested in
patreon links in description you know
the jazz and that's it one star done
next time we'll start working on the
planetary system i hope you enjoyed and
until next time
edgar out
you
