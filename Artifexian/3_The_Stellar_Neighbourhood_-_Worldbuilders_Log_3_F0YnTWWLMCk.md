# The Stellar Neighbourhood - Worldbuilderâ€™s Log 3

good morning interweb world builders log
three last time we built a planetary
system this time we're going to zoom out
a little bit and we're going to build
something more on the galactic scale
we're going to build a little stellar
neighborhood for our home system but
first as always let's do some follow-up
i've updated the reference dock to
include information
from the last video which is all
here so again links in description to
patreon if you want to pick up a copy of
this it's over on patreon we got new
artwork happening here i am
not responsible for this artwork this
artwork has been produced by an actual
artist
shout out to vanga van gogh on
deviantart i reached out to them asked
if
they'd be up for me commissioning them
for the series they said yes and i am
so stupidly happy it's not even funny so
no more of my crap artwork actual proper
artwork and look how good this is look
how professional and awesome this is i
cannot wait for vanga van gogh to get
his hands on the spec bio part of this
series and i think it'll look great the
reference stock will look
amazing so um yeah massive thanks to
vangovan gog for coming on board folks
go check them out links are in the
description show them some love
tell them i sent you etc next up some
comments lots of feedback on the last
video a couple of people were unhappy
with the two asteroid belts i had
constructed and i kind of have to say i
agree
shout out daniel bamberger here who's an
astronomer just
tangent for a second it's kind of
awesome that there's actual
professionals in commons because like
i'm not an astronomer i'm not a
zoologist i'm not a linguist i am an
expert in one of the things i'm going to
talk about in this series so it's
awesome that there's pros knocking
around anyways daniel breaks down things
really nicely here as saying asteroid
belts are usually controlled by a gas
giant outside or inside of the asteroid
belt as in an inward orbit so neptune
controls the kuiper belt and jupiter
controls the asteroid belt and it's
outside the belt you run into problems
when like in my system you have a gas
giant controlling both something inwards
of it and something outwards of it so
it's a little bit unrealistic for now
i'm going to leave it i'm going to think
about it
maybe i might update it to just have a
single asteroid belt we'll see but shout
out daniel again thanks for feedback
also they're a distant cousin apparently
of bold from bold's law of fame which is
just like nuts to think about whoever
built this planet made it a small world
i agree and finally and most important
of all the worldsmith has been updated
major update this time so this is the
worldsmith 2.0 again links are in the
description i've added an email address
here so if you have any book reports
please email me it's just that at the
moment i'm getting them in um youtube
comments discord patreon
twitter and email and it's kind of all
over the shop so if you got a bug report
send it to the email that way
everything's in one place and it's a
little bit easier for me to deal with it
next change is i've included a version
history tab actually let me make this
sheet a little bit bigger i've included
the version history tab so you know what
changes have been completed the major
change i spoke about a second ago is in
the galaxy sheet
which we'll be using today so that's
follow-up done without further ado let's
head on over to the galaxy tab instead
of doing the usual thing where i do like
explanation time
and then
build something i'm just gonna do
explanation and building at the same
time might flow a little bit better
we'll see so the first thing spreadsheet
wants us to do is to work out some
galactic characteristics namely it wants
us to work out the galactic radius how
big our galaxy is
specifically our spire galaxy because
this spreadsheet is working on the
assumption that we're dealing with a
spiral galaxy now the milky way is about
50 000 light years
in radius although i believe of late
that's been updated and it's actually a
little bit bigger than that but either
way in the ballpark of 50 000 light
years is about the milky way in terms of
an upper and lower bound here it's kind
of hard to say i know i've seen galaxies
that are quoted as being like 10 000
light years in radius and i think the
biggest one i've ever read about is a
spiral galaxy that's i think was like a
quarter million light years in radius i
think so maybe take that as a loose like
upper and lower bound 10 000 light years
in radius up to like 200 000 light years
in radius
i'm gonna go for a relatively small
galaxy maybe less than the milky way so
let's do maybe let's do maybe 30 000
light years
a little more than half
of the milky way yeah
for now anyways so the spreadsheet then
computes the galactic habitable zone now
the galactic hablo zone is a bit of a
contentious hypothesis lots of people
think it's legit others think it's a
load of hokum but for us it kind of um
is a good tool to have to like limit the
amount of locations where a star system
can be in the galaxy and the way this
works is that if you take a spiral
galaxy like so there will exist a sort
of ring
about half the way out from the core to
about two-thirds of the way out from the
core
something like that that's like the
ideal location for a star system the
reason being you don't want to be too
close to the core the core has got like
lots of densely packed stars it's a bit
messy in there but violent not great for
habitability you also don't want to be
too far away from the core right in the
outskirts of the galaxy because there's
less stuff there and perhaps so little
stuff that there's not enough to build a
habitable star system
so about half the way out to about two
thirds of the way out is generally
considered the galactic habitable zone
now there's a few other considerations
that the spreadsheet doesn't take into
account because there's no need but just
fyi you don't want your um star system
to orbit in the spiral arms spiral arms
are like star producing factories really
violent places again not great for
habitability
so you want your star system
just outside spiral arms and in order
for that star system to remain outside
spiral arms it's got to orbit on a
nearly perfect circular orbit because if
it was on a really eccentric orbit it
would dip in the now spiral arms over
geological time and that would be no
bueno and i guess the final sailing
point is that the star system should not
have a very inclined orbit around the
galactic core because if the inclination
is too high it'll like pop out of the
plane of the galaxy out of the galactic
disk
and that's also not great
so ideal location a half to two-thirds
of the way out from the galactic core in
a spiral galaxy
not in the spiral arms
on a nearly circular orbit
and on a low
inclination orbit that's basically the
sort of most important considerations
when it comes to habitability but do
bear in mind like i said it's a little
bit contentious so you can kind of work
around it if you so desire now in our
spiral galaxy here we see that the
galactic capital zone is between about
14 000 light years to 18 000 light years
out from the core so we want to plot the
location of our stellar neighborhood and
by extension our star system somewhere
within that range
so i'm going to say something like again
it doesn't really matter let's say
somewhere sort of in the middle
let's say like 16 000 lighters
now next we need to input the radius of
our stellar neighborhood and what this
means is that if you imagine this is our
star system
the radius we select will define a
region of space around our star system a
spherical region of space whereby any
stars and star systems inside said
region are said to be in our home
systems
stellar neighborhood a dare i give my
own work credit here i think this is a
really useful tool for building like um
interstellar political entities so like
we could have like the artifexia
hegemony and it is defined as any and
all star systems within a x-liter radius
from artifexia are under the political
influence of artifexia again upper and
lower bounds here are completely
arbitrary you can make things as big or
as small as you want if you go too small
remember space is largely empty so there
may not be anything in your stellar
neighborhood and if you go way too big
your stellar neighborhood again might
pop out of the plane of the galaxy and
given that around the solar system our
solar system the galaxy is about a
thousand light years thick you wouldn't
want to have your stellar neighborhood
be greater than 500 light years in
radius
so yeah no min
but we'll say
radius should be
less than
somewhere around 500 light years
so to start off i'm just going to say
let's say something like uh maybe 10
lighters
say there's a 10 lighter bubble around
the artifexian star system
now next we need to input how many stars
will be in
that bubble of space what is the density
of the stars the more stars per cubic
light year there are
the more densely packed our stellar
neighborhood would be on average for the
milky way it's about .006 stars per
cubic light year and in the vicinity of
our solar system it's about point zero
zero three to point zero zero four stars
per cubic light year like super low
densities because again space is mostly
empty so i would say again as a range
here point zero zero and then some sort
of number that low i might change this
to just
point zero zero four just for the crack
and that's all the input done the
spreadsheet is going to take over
completely from here so it looks at the
size of the bubble of space
around artifexia around the home star
system and it looks at the density and
then it populates
that bubble of space with an appropriate
amount of stellar types
namely main sequence stars white dwarfs
brown dwarfs giant stars and other
stellar mass objects so we've talked
about main sequence stars
a fine gong before
kiss me all stars really massive very
rare m stars extremely low mass very
common and that's borne out in the
number here so in this bubble of space
we have
none of the high mass stars one g star
one k star and twelve m stars white
dwarfs are stellar remnants of low mass
stars so when low mass stars completely
die they leave behind a white dwarf
which is an object about the size of
earth
but has the mass comparable to a star
and there's two of them in our
neighborhood brown dwarfs are like
planet star things they're objects that
never quite became stars
but they aren't kind of planets either
they sort of blur the line in between
planet and star they're like really
really really really massive jupiters
giant stars are like your i think of
yellow giants red giants blue giants i
think hyper giants supergiants these are
all stars that are in the process of
dying
they're again incredibly violent and you
don't really want to have any of them
around your stellar neighborhood it just
it's bad news for all the other
residents of the neighborhood
and then other stellar mass objects here
are things like neutron stars and black
holes and those are the dead remnants of
high mass stars so when high mass stars
die they leave behind neutron stars or
black holes so i'm looking at the spread
here and i see an immediate problem
remember the artifexia star was an f
star right but given the size of our
stellar neighborhood and the density
there's no f star here so there is no
artifexia in this space so i'm just
gonna either increase the size
or increase the stellar density until we
get at least one f-star and then that
boil that's going to be artifexia so
let's just try and uh let's bump this up
maybe 11.
boom all right there we go one f-star
and actually i'm gonna make a 12 just
because 12 is a really nice number there
we go one f-star two g stars three k
stars 20 m stars the vast majority of
stars are going to be m stars
three white dwarfs and five brown dwarfs
no giant stars perfect no neutron stars
black holes
what we'd expect and that's for a total
of 34 stellar mass objects in our solar
neighborhood so next up we know that we
have 34 stereo mass objects but how are
they arranged are they all in individual
systems
goal 34 systems one object per system
are they all in binary systems ternary
systems etc now this is a new thing i
found out in making this calculator i
found this paper this admittedly
somewhat old paper but it does do a neat
thing and gives a statistical breakdown
of the various types of system 56 of
star systems according to this one paper
are single star systems 33 are double a
percent or triple and then three percent
are four or more star systems and that's
dope i've never found a statistical
spread before making the world smith
so i implemented here and in so far as
possible
the spreadsheet tries to stick to the
numbers from the paper so in our case
we're looking at ten single star systems
seven binary systems two triple star
systems and one quadruple system and
that that's grand and one of those boils
that's going to be artifexia for a total
of 20 star systems so 34 stellar mass
objects distributed realistically into
20 star systems now we know how many
star systems there are the next question
to ask is
where are they in that stellar
neighborhood in that bubble of space and
this is where the star system coordinate
generator comes in the spreadsheet will
generate the appropriate amount of
systems so in this case we have 20
systems uh the first system is the home
star system so in my case it's artifexia
and it is centered at the
center of the bubble of space its
coordinates are 0 0 0 and the
spreadsheet randomly generates a set of
3d coordinates for each of the star
systems and it makes sure that those
coordinates fall inside the bubble and
then it computes the distance from each
of these systems to the home system any
cells in green here represent the
closest star systems and any cells in
red represent the furthest away star
systems from the home star system
now i don't intend for this setting to
be like an interstellar sort of thing
i'm kind of more doing all this for the
demo so i don't really care
exactly where each of these systems are
but one thing i do care about is
the closest system
to my home system that i care about in
this case system seven i need that to be
beyond my stars hill sphere so again
from the last time the hill sphere is
like a region space around an object
whereby if anything orbits within that
region
it'll orbit the object it'd be pretty
bad news if another star system was
inside the hill sphere of the artifexia
star system and again as mentioned in
the previous video hill spheres for
stars are like notoriously hard to
compute but i believe the wikipedia page
for solar system lists the sun's hill
sphere being anywhere between one and
three light years
so just to be safe and taking into
account that my star is more massive
than the sun i kind of want this closer
system to be at maybe at least three
light years away
just to make absolutely sure and the way
i can do this is by simply clicking on
any random blank cell and then just
hitting
backspace for example
and the spreadsheet computes a whole new
set of numbers now this is important the
way google sheets works with random
numbers is that they are dynamically
updating so anytime you do anything to
the sheet or any other sheet in the
worldsmith these numbers here they will
all change so if i hit backspace again
they'll change again they'll change
again if i go up here and i edit this
figure
say something else
all of these numbers will change again
so if you do find something that you
really enjoy that you really like uh
don't touch the spreadsheet take a
screenshot before moving on but i'm
going to use this to my advantage here
i'm just going to keep hitting backspace
until i find a shortest distance that is
above
three light years and then more gravy
and to help me out i don't need to
continuously read the numbers here i'm
just going to chat in a quick formula
so i'm going to say
if this is not important at all it's
just a little aid for me
if the minimum value
between
in this set here
if that value is greater than
three
greater than or equal to three
dear spreadsheet i would like you to
print
yes
there we go just so i can
definitely know
that i'm i'm safe and if it's not if
it's not greater than legal retreat i
just want you to leave the cell blank
all right so that is not ground trees
that this cell here is blank so time
lapse time i'm just gonna hit backspace
for like five minutes or something and
see can we get the
the
closest star system to artifexia to be
greater than three light years all right
see you in a little bit
all right that took way too long and
halfway through i was like wait a minute
this isn't even the easiest way of doing
this but here we are we live with our
mistakes so our closest star system here
is star system 9 3.99 light years
definitely safe
and again
once you find something you like don't
touch the spreadsheet
now final thing i want to do is i want
to have the ability to make artwork
out of this like to depict the standard
neighborhood so you see the way the
coordinates are formatted in a very
particular way that's not an accident so
if i go to this wonderful site called
geogebra
or however it should be pronounced and
we go to the 3d calculator over here
we get a 3d graph this is extremely
useful for interstellar world building i
find
or interstellar mapping uh before we do
anything though i just like to mess with
some settings so give me two seconds
time lapse engaged
i'm going to start by putting in my
starter bubble so a little bit of maths
here just the equation for a 3d sphere x
squared plus
y squared
plus
z squared
is equal to the radius of the stellar
empire which was 12 in our case
squared i'm going to click on the sphere
uh just as a quality life thing make it
gray and drop the opacity so it's barely
visible but it is still there and with
that in place all i have to do is go
back over to the wordsmith and simply
copy the coordinates as they are because
they're formatted correctly and just
drop them in here
bingo and there that boil that right
there that is artifexia let's make them
let's make them a uh
uh
green color we'll say no no
let's make them an orange color okay and
that's it you just simply go to sheet
select the next coordinate system copy
it
drop it into g algebra
hit return
done
time lapse engaged
now this guy is our closest
star system so i am going to drop it in
and change its color to green just to
highlight it
that's system j where system j there he
is
make it green perfect
and there we go one stetter empire
done
or not empire neighborhood
done now one thing you'll notice here is
that there seem to be very gathered
around the sort of center and that's a
consequence of the way google sheets
distributes random numbers
so if you're really concerned about it
you can just simply click and drag on a
system and move it around in 3d space
using geogebra and you can get a
distribution that you may like more
again i'm not going for an interstellar
setting here so i'm actually not that
buttered the only thing i'm worried
about is making sure that no star
comes within like a critical range of
artifexia now some of these other stars
may be too close to one another but
again
no action's gonna be happening there so
i don't really care
and i can just chalk it up to like
observational
flaws like we think they're this close
together but in actuality they're not
all that sort of jazz i only care about
artifacts yeah and i have good clearance
around it which is nice
all right so what i'm going to do is i
am going to i'm going to tinker just a
little bit more with this um to get the
sort of like angle and pose correct take
a screenshot of it and then we'll be
able to bring it or van gaal would be
able to bring it into uh photoshop or
whatever and make some cool artwork from
this
so final time-lapse engaged
okay so
that was a whole thing
you saw me there create a whole bunch of
duplicates so we have our star systems
go from b here to t
and i created i duplicated all of them
so now we have b1 all the way to t1 and
what i did was i took the z coordinate
of the star system so this is our star
system proper i took the z-coordinate of
it and dropped it to zero so it's
sitting exactly in the plane and i've
done that for art purposes like i'm
envisaging drawing a nice little line
down to the plane and then perhaps
another line there to like locate it in
3d space
so that's purely just an art thing so
the system proper
looks
like
this
and then all the helper points look like
this
which is a little bit messy but i think
it's workable so i'm gonna screenshot
that take it away some art will be
created and then i'll add it to
reference stock etc you know the drill
and that's this episode done

habitual world thank you all so much for
